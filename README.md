# AI Agent Orchestrator Framework 🚀

**Transform any AI coding assistant into a specialized team of expert developers**

Stop getting generic responses from AI tools. This framework automatically assigns the right persona to your task, giving you expert-level, role-specific outputs that feel like working with a real development team.

## 🎯 Quick Start (30 seconds)

1. **Download** → Copy `agents.md` to your project root
2. **Use** → Add `@agents` before any prompt in your AI tool
3. **Done** → Get expert-level, role-specific responses instantly

```bash
# Instead of this generic prompt:
"Create a login system"

# Use this for expert-level output:
"@agents Create a secure login system with OAuth2"
```

**Result**: Automatically routes to Security Engineer + Backend Engineer personas for production-ready security implementation.

## 🔥 Why This Changes Everything

| **Before** | **After** |
|------------|-----------|
| Generic AI responses | Expert persona-specific outputs |
| "Create some tests" | QA Lead designs comprehensive test strategy |
| "Deploy this app" | DevOps Engineer provides production pipeline |
| "Fix this bug" | Senior Engineer analyzes root cause + solution |
| Inconsistent quality | Professional-grade, consistent outputs |

## 🧠 Smart Orchestrator Logic

The framework uses advanced prompt analysis to automatically assign the right personas:

### Keyword-Based Routing
```bash
"deploy" → DevOps Engineer
"security" → Security Engineer  
"test automation" → SDET
"user stories" → Product Owner
"code review" → Tech Lead
"database optimization" → Senior Software Engineer + Data Engineer
```

### Multi-Persona Assignment
Complex tasks automatically get multiple experts:
```bash
"Build e-commerce checkout flow" → 
Product Owner + Frontend Engineer + Backend Engineer + Security Engineer + QA Lead
```

### Context-Aware Intelligence
- **Project Phase Detection**: Planning → Product Owner, Implementation → Engineers
- **Technology Stack Awareness**: React → Frontend Engineer, AWS → DevOps Engineer
- **Complexity Assessment**: Simple → Software Engineer, Complex → Senior + Architect
