# Agents.md - AI Agent Framework with Intelligent Orchestrator

## Framework Overview

This document defines AI agents with intelligent persona assignment for software development workflows. The orchestrator automatically assigns specialized personas based on task analysis, delivering role-specific, context-aware outputs.

## ðŸš€ Quick Usage

**Simple**: Add `@agents` before any prompt in your AI tool
```
@agents "Create a secure login system with OAuth2"
```
**Result**: Automatically routes to Security Engineer + Backend Engineer for expert-level implementation.

## ðŸŽ¯ Auto-Activation Triggers

The orchestrator activates automatically when it detects these patterns in your prompts:

### Instant Activation Keywords
- `@agents` - Explicit activation (recommended)
- `using agents framework` - Context reference
- `as [persona name]` - Direct persona request

### Smart Detection Patterns
- **Security Focus**: `secure`, `authentication`, `encryption`, `vulnerability`
- **Architecture**: `design system`, `scalable`, `microservices`, `architecture`
- **DevOps**: `deploy`, `pipeline`, `docker`, `kubernetes`, `CI/CD`
- **Quality**: `test strategy`, `automation`, `quality assurance`
- **Leadership**: `plan sprint`, `user stories`, `roadmap`, `team coordination`

## Assignment Logic

### Primary Assignment Rules

1. **Keyword Matching**: Analyze prompt for role-specific trigger words
2. **Context Analysis**: Consider project phase and current focus area
3. **Task Complexity**: Identify if multiple personas needed
4. **Output Type**: Match expected deliverable with appropriate persona
5. **Seniority Level**: Match task complexity with appropriate experience level

### Multi-Persona Scenarios

Complex tasks may require multiple personas:

- **Full-Stack Feature**: Product Owner â†’ Architect â†’ Senior Software Engineer â†’ SDET â†’ DevOps
- **Security Implementation**: Security Engineer â†’ CISA â†’ DevOps Engineer
- **Mobile App Development**: Product Owner â†’ Mobile Engineer â†’ QA Lead â†’ DevOps
- **Data Platform**: Data Engineer â†’ Architect â†’ DevOps Engineer â†’ Security Engineer
- **Agile Process Improvement**: Scrum Master â†’ Tech Lead â†’ QA Lead

### Hierarchical Assignment

When multiple personas could apply, prioritize by:
1. **Specialized expertise** (Security Engineer over Software Engineer for security tasks)
2. **Leadership level** (Tech Lead over Software Engineer for team coordination)
3. **Experience level** (Senior over regular for complex implementations)
4. **Domain expertise** (Mobile Engineer over Frontend Engineer for mobile-specific tasks)

### Fallback Strategy

If no clear persona match:
1. Default to **Software Engineer** for general development tasks
2. Default to **Tech Lead** for coordination tasks
3. Default to **Architect** for design tasks
4. Request clarification if highly ambiguous
5. Suggest persona combination for complex requests
